 <h1>Value Iteration</h1>
 <applet code="VIgui.class" height="550" width="800">
 Java is not working.  This has been tested in Firefox, and it works there!
</applet>
<p>This applet shows how value iteration works for a simple 10x10 grid
world. The numbers in the bottom left of each square shows the value
of the grid point. The blue arrows show the optimal action based on the
current value function (when it
looks like a star, all actions are optimal). To start, press "step".
</p>
<p>There are 4 actions available: up, down, left and
right. If the agent carries out one of these actions, it have a 0.7
chance of going one step in the desired
direction and a 0.1 chance of going one step in any of the other three
directions. If it bumps into the outside wall (i.e., the square
computed as above is outside the grid), there is a penalty on 1 (i.e.,
a reward of -1) and the agent doesn't
actually move.
</p>
<p>In this example, there are four rewarding states (apart from the
walls), one worth +10 (at position (9,8); 9 across and 8 down), one
worth +3 (at position (8,3)), one
worth -5 (at position (4,5)) and one -10 (at position (4,8)). In each
if these states the agent gets the reward when
it carries out an action in that state (when it leaves the state, not
when it enters). You can see these when you press "step" once after a
"reset". If "Absorbing states" is checked, the positive reward states
are absorbing; the agent gets no more rewards after entering those
states. If the box
is not checked, when an agent reaches one of those states, no
matter what it does at the next step, it is flung, at random,
to one of the 4 corners of the grid world. [Does this make a
difference? Try the non-discounted case (i.e., where discount=1.0).]
</p>
<p>The initial discount rate is 0.9. You can either type in a new
number or increment or decrement it by 0.1. It is interesting to try
the value iteration
at different discount rates. Try 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, (and 0.99,
0.995 and 1.0 when there is an absorbing state). Look,
in particular,
at the policy for the points 2&amp;3-across and 6&amp;7-down, and
around the +3 reward. Can you explain why the optimal policy changes as
the value
function is
built? Can you explain the direction in the optimal policy for each
discount rate?
</p>
<p>You can also change the initial value for each state (i.e, the value
that value iteration
starts with). See if changing this value affects the final value or the
rate that we approach the final value.
</p>
<p>You can also change the contrast (the mapping
between non-extreme values and colour); this is mainly for showing in
classrooms where often we couldn't see the colour changes. You can also
change the
size of the grid (this makes most sense if you are using the applet
viewer).
